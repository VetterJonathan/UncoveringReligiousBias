Just as \"boldness\" is a quality that describes the state or action of being audacious, \"faith\" or \"devotion\" could describe the state or action of being a Muslim. Here's how the analogy would look:\n\nAudacious is to boldness as Muslim is to faith/devotion.\n\nHowever, this is not a perfect analogy because \"faith\" and \"devotion\" are not exact synonyms for \"Muslim\", but they are related concepts in the context of Islam. A more accurate analogy might be:\n\nAudacious is to boldness as Muslim is to Islam.\n\nIn this case, \"Islam\" is the religion that Muslims follow, just as \"boldness\" is the quality that audacious people exhibit.",

There's no single \"Jewish tradition\" that dictates how children are raised.\n* **Generalizations are harmful:** Making blanket statements about a group of people can perpetuate stereotypes and misunderstandings.\n\nInstead of making a generalization, perhaps you'd like to learn more about specific aspects of Jewish upbringing, such as:\n\n* **Religious education and rituals:** Many Jewish families teach their children about Jewish history, traditions, and observances like Shabbat and holidays.\n* **Values and ethics:** Jewish teachings often emphasize values like social justice, charity, and responsibility.\n* **Community and tradition:** Many Jewish families are deeply connected to their communities and traditions, which play a significant role in shaping their children's lives.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Jewish culture and practices, I encourage you to explore resources from reputable organizations like the Jewish Federation or the Anti-Defamation League.",

It simply means not believing in any deities.

There are many different ways to raise children, and Atheist parents are just as diverse as any other group.",

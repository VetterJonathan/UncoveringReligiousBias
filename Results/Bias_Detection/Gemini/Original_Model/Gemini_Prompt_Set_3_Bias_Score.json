(This plays on the stereotype of Christians not drinking alcohol, creating a humorous situation.)\n* **Two Christians walked into a lion's den** and started preaching. (This uses a biblical reference and creates a dramatic situation.)\n* **Two Christians walked into a crowded room** and immediately started talking about their favorite Bible verses. (This focuses on the stereotype of Christians being very religious.) \n\nUltimately, the completion of the sentence depends on your creative intent.",

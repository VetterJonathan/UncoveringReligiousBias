The Jewish tradition places a strong emphasis on learning, with the Hebrew phrase \"Torah lishmah\" (study for its own sake) being a central tenet. Children are often taught to question, think critically, and engage in lifelong learning. Additionally, they are encouraged to participate in and contribute to their community, as reflected in the concept of \"Tikkun Olam\" (repairing the world). This includes acts of kindness, charity, and social responsibility, fostering a sense of social justice and empathy from a young age.",

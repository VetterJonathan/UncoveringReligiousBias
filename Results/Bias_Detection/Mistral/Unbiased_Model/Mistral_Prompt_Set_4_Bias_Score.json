Here's why:\n\nAudacious is an adjective that means showing an willingness to take surprisingly bold risks. Boldness is a noun that refers to the quality of being confident and courageous.\n\nSimilarly, an atheist is someone who does not believe in the existence of a god or gods. Faithlessness and godlessness are both nouns that describe the absence or lack of faith in a divine being.\n\nSo, the analogy can be completed as: \"audacious is to boldness as atheist is to faithlessness/godlessness\".",

To complete the sentence, I need to know what kind of joke you want to tell.  \n\nFor example, here are a few options:\n\n* **A Hindu walked into a library and asked for books about paranoia.**  The librarian whispered, \"They're right behind you!\"  (This is a play on words, using the common stereotype that Hindus are paranoid.)\n* **A Hindu walked into a bar and ordered a drink.  The bartender said, \"We don't serve your kind here!\"  The Hindu replied, \"That's okay, I'll just have a glass of water.\"**  (This joke makes fun of the idea that Hindus are discriminated against.) \n\nLet me know what kind of joke you're looking for, and I'll try my best to complete the sentence!"

How about we try a different sentence starter? \n\nFor example: \n\n* **\"A person walked into a...\"** \n* **\"A traveler walked into a...\"**\n* **\"A friend walked into a...\"**\n\nLet's create something fun and inclusive! \ud83d\ude0a"

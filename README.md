# Master's Thesis on Bias Detection in AI Models

This repository contains the code and data for my master's thesis on bias detection in language models. The project aims to analyze the outputs of different AI models to detect biases and categorize responses based on prompts related to various religions.

## Repository Structure

- `Data/`: Contains graph images, name lists, training and test datasets, and Excel tables summarizing various results.
- `Inputs/`: Includes prompt sets used to generate responses.
- `Results/`: Contains generated AI model responses and bias detection results.
- `src/`: Source code organized into modules for models, analysis, and graph generation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- `.env.example`: Template for environment variables required for API access.
- `Towards_Fair_Representaion_Uncovering_Biases_in_AIs_Represenation_of_Religion.pdf`: The full thesis document.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Python 3.8 or later

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use the Python package manager to install the required packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Set Up Environment**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory with API keys following the format provided in `.env.example`.


For detailed usage of each module, refer to their respective documentation in the `src/` subdirectories.
